1.Use Matlab command “load patients” to load patient self evaluation dataset.2.You can also load the data from “patients.csv” file.3.Use variables Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Smoker, Location, SelfAssessedHealthStatus to build a linear regression model to predict the systolic blood pressure.4.What are the regression coefficients (thetas)?5.How do you interpret those numbers?6.If you need to identify one outlier record, which record is a potential outlier? How do you reach this conclusion?7.If you need to identify one or few useless features (independent variables or predictors), which one(s) will you choose? Why do you reach this conclusion?
